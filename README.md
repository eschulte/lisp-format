# Lisp-Format --- A tool to format lisp code.

This lisp-format script aims to provide the same functionality as
clang-format only for lisp languages instead of for C languages.
Emacs is used to perform formatting.  The behavior of clang-format is
followed as closely as possible with the goal of a direct drop in
replacement in most contexts.

This script is suitable for (re)formatting lisp code using an external
process.  This script may be marked as executable and executed
directly on the command line as follows.

```shell
chmod +x lisp-format
./lisp-format -h
```

This script is appropriate for use in git commit hooks, see
[Running lisp-format git hooks](#running-lisp-format-git-hooks).

## Customizing lisp-format

Clang-format allows for customized "styles" to be specified by
writing .clang-format files in the base of code repository and
passing the -style=file flag to clang-format.  Lisp-format
supports the same using .lisp-format files.  These files may hold
arbitrary emacs-lisp code, and they will be loaded before every
run of lisp-format.  The following example file will (1) load
slime assuming you have slime installed via quicklisp, (2) adjust
the syntax-table for special reader macro characters, and (3)
specify indentation for non-standard functions (e.g., from the
popular common lisp Alexandria package).

```lisp
;;;; -*- emacs-lisp -*-
(set-default 'indent-tabs-mode nil)
(mapc (lambda (dir) (add-to-list 'load-path dir))
      (directory-files
       (concat (getenv "QUICK_LISP")
               "/dists/quicklisp/software/") t "slime-v*"))
(require 'slime)

;;; Syntax table extension for curry-compose-reader-macros
(modify-syntax-entry ?\[ "(]" lisp-mode-syntax-table)
(modify-syntax-entry ?\] ")[" lisp-mode-syntax-table)
(modify-syntax-entry ?\{ "(}" lisp-mode-syntax-table)
(modify-syntax-entry ?\} "){" lisp-mode-syntax-table)
(modify-syntax-entry ?\« "(»" lisp-mode-syntax-table)
(modify-syntax-entry ?\» ")«" lisp-mode-syntax-table)

;;; Specify indentation levels for specific functions.
(mapc (lambda (pair) (put (first pair) 'lisp-indent-function (second pair)))
      '((if-let 1)
        (if-let* 1)))
```

As described in the "git lisp-format -h" output, you can use "git
config" to change the default style to "file" with the following
command (run in a git repository).

```shell
git config lispFormat.style "file"
```

Running the above and adding a .lisp-format file to the based of a
git repository enables customization of the lisp-format behavior.

Currently lisp-format only exports a single configuration variable
which may be customized to run fixers on formatted regions of code.
See the documentation of `*LISP-FORMAT-FIXERS**` for details.  For
example to remove all tabs add the following:

```lisp
;; NOTE: unless indent-tabs-mode is `set-default' to nil
;; subsequent fixers after untabify could themselves add
;; tabs.
(set-default 'indent-tabs-mode nil)
(push 'untabify *lisp-format-fixers*)
```

## Running lisp-format git hooks

The lisp-format script is appropriate for use in git commit hooks.  In
fact the
[git-clang-format script](https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk/tools/clang-format/git-clang-format)
may be fairly trivially converted into a git-lisp-format script by
replacing "clang" with "lisp" and changing the in-scope file
extensions as follows.

```shell
curl -s https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk/tools/clang-format/git-clang-format \
    |sed \
    "s/clang-format/lisp-format/g;s/clangFormat/lispFormat/;
     s/default_extensions =.*\$/default_extensions = ','.join(['lisp','cl','asd','scm','el'])/;
     /# From clang\/lib\/Frontend\/FrontendOptions.cpp, all lower case/,/])/d" \
    > /usr/bin/git-lisp-format

chmod +x /usr/bin/git-lisp-format
```

After the resulting git-lisp-format is added to your path then git can
execute this file by running "git lisp-format."

See
[setting up git clang format](https://dx13.co.uk/articles/2015/04/03/setting-up-git-clang-format/)
for an example description of a work flow leveraging git hooks and
git-clang-format to ensure that code is well formatted before every
commit (i.e., by writing the following shell code to an executable
file named `pre-commit` in a repository's `.git/hooks/` directory).
This work flow may be trivially adopted to use git-lisp-format for
lispy code.

It is relatively easy to configure git to run lisp-format before every
commit, and reject commits which are not well formatted.  The
following two subsections describe how to do this using a [Pre-commit
hook shell script](#pre-commit-hook-shell-script) or using the
[Pre-commit framework](#pre-commit-framework).

### Pre-commit hook shell script

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# pre-commit shell script to run git-lisp-format.
OUTPUT=$(git lisp-format --diff)
if [ "${OUTPUT}" == "no modified files to format" ] ||
   [ "${OUTPUT}" == "lisp-format did not modify any files" ];then
    exit 0
else
    echo "Run git lisp-format, then commit."
    exit 1
fi
```

### Pre-commit framework

User-specific customization of lisp-format may be accomplished by
writing emacs-lisp code to an configuration file named
`~/.lisp-formatrc` in the users home directory.  This may be useful
for adding directories to the load path searched by lisp-format.

The `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` file in this directory provides a
[pre-commit framework](https://pre-commit.com/) hook for running
lisp-format.  This hook requires the pre-commit framework to be
installed on your system and configured for each git repository. For
more information please refer to:
- [pre-commit installation](https://pre-commit.com/#install)
- [pre-commit plugins](https://pre-commit.com/#plugins) (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)
- [pre-commit usage](https://pre-commit.com/#usage)
